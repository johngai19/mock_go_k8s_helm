# Go Mock Packages for Frontend Testing

## Overview

This project contains mock implementations for a Go-based backend system that interacts with Kubernetes (k8s) and Helm. The purpose of these mock packages is to facilitate frontend development and testing by providing a lightweight, dependency-free alternative to the real backend services. These mocks simulate the API interfaces and data structures of the original packages but do not perform any actual k8s or Helm operations. They return predefined or dynamically generated mock data suitable for frontend testing scenarios.

## Project Structure

The mock project mirrors the structure of the original Go project. Each original package that was mocked has a corresponding directory within the `go_k8s_helm` directory. Inside each of these, you will find:

*   `*_mock.go`: This file contains the mock implementation of the interfaces, functions, and types from the original package.
*   `*_test.go`: This is the original unit test file from your project, copied over to test the compatibility of the mock implementation. Note that some tests might fail or be skipped, as explained in the "Unit Tests" section below.

The main Go module is initialized at the root of the `mock_go_project` directory (`/home/ubuntu/mock_go_project/go.mod`). All internal package imports have been adjusted to reflect this single-module structure (e.g., `mock_project/go_k8s_helm/internal/k8sutils`).

Key mocked packages include:

*   `go_k8s_helm/backupmanager`
*   `go_k8s_helm/chartconfigmanager`
*   `go_k8s_helm/configloader`
*   `go_k8s_helm/internal/helmutils` (mocking the original `client.go`)
*   `go_k8s_helm/internal/k8sutils` (mocking the original `auth.go`)

## How to Use

1.  **Integration**: Replace the import paths in your frontend's Go test environment or a local testing server to point to these mock packages instead of the original ones.
2.  **Data Customization**: The mock functions currently return generic simulated data. You can modify the `*_mock.go` files to return specific data payloads that match your frontend testing requirements for different scenarios.
3.  **Testing**: Run your frontend application against the service using these mock backends. The APIs should behave as per the defined interfaces, returning mock data.

## Unit Tests

The original unit test files (`*_test.go`) have been included alongside their respective mock implementations. These tests were run in the generation environment (Go 1.22.3 on Linux).

*   **Interface Compatibility**: The primary goal of running these tests was to ensure that the mock implementations correctly satisfy the interfaces and function signatures defined in the original packages and used by the tests. Most compilation errors related to type mismatches, missing methods, or incorrect function signatures have been resolved.
*   **Functional Test Failures (Expected)**: Many unit tests in the original project likely perform functional testing, asserting specific outcomes based on interactions with a real Kubernetes cluster, Helm, or configuration files. **These tests are expected to fail or panic when run against the mock implementations.** The mocks do not simulate the underlying logic or side effects of the original services (e.g., file I/O, actual k8s API calls). For instance:
    *   Tests for `configloader` that expect specific values from parsed configuration files will likely fail because the mock `Load` function returns predefined data and doesn't read actual files.
    *   Tests for `helmutils` or `k8sutils` that verify interactions with a Kubernetes cluster will fail because the mock clientset (e.g., `fake.NewSimpleClientset()`) does not replicate a live environment's behavior.
*   **Purpose of Included Tests**: The tests are included to help you verify that the mock interfaces align with what your existing tests expect in terms of structure and types. You can adapt these tests or write new ones specifically for validating the mock behavior if needed for your frontend testing harness.

During the generation process, all mock packages were made to compile successfully against their corresponding test files. The `go test ./...` command was run from the `mock_go_project` root. While many individual tests within suites passed (especially those checking basic interface satisfaction or simple mock returns), suites with functional assertions against non-existent backend logic (like `configloader`'s file parsing or `helmutils`'s k8s interactions) showed failures as anticipated.

## Limitations

*   **No Real Backend Logic**: These are pure mocks. They do not replicate the business logic, state management, or external interactions (k8s, Helm, file system I/O beyond basic mock returns) of the original services.
*   **Data is Simulated**: The data returned by mock functions is hardcoded or minimally dynamic. For complex frontend scenarios, you may need to customize the mock data generation within the `*_mock.go` files.
*   **Error Simulation**: Error handling in the mocks is basic. Specific error conditions from the real services might not be fully replicated unless explicitly added to the mock implementations.

This mock project should provide a solid foundation for your frontend testing needs by offering a compatible, lightweight set of backend stubs.
